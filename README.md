# Full Stack Open

Here's a brief summary of what I've learned in each part:

**Part 0:** The basics of how the browser communicates with the server and what a single-page application means.

**Part 1:** How to use Javascript and the React library to create components, states and event handlers. 

**Part 2:** Refactoring modules, creating forms, using a JSON server, adding styles.

**Part 3:** Building a backend with NodeJS, what RESTful means, deploying app to internet, using MongoDB as database, ESLint and validation.

**Part 4:** Testing the backend (supertest), using async/await, implementing users and authorization.

**Part 5:** Showing/hiding components in frontend, testing with Jest and Cypress.

**Part 6:** Using Redux with Redux Toolkit.

**Part 7:** Implementing React router and custom hooks, styling with styled components.

The exercises in part 7 summed up everything learned throughout the course, so the apps in that folder should showcase most of the technologies I've learned.

I've started on part 8, where I'll be learning GraphQL.
