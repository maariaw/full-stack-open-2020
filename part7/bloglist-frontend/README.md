# Bloglist Frontend

The bloglist app is a project that was built on during several parts of the Full Stack Open course. The state of the project in this folder represents the final stage of the frontend, after completing all the exercises in the base course.

The frontend uses React with Redux for controlling state and styled-components for styling. End-to-end testing is done with Cypress. The stack choises apart from style were required by the course. For styling I chose styled-components out of a few other options, because it seemed like something you'd have to try in practice to really learn.
