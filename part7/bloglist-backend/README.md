The bloglist app is a project that was built on during several parts of the Full Stack Open course. The state of the project in this folder represents the final stage of the backend, after completing all the exercises in the base course.

The backend uses Node.JS with Express. Storage solution is the document database MongoDB. Jest with SuperTest library is used for testing. The stack choises were determined by the course material.
